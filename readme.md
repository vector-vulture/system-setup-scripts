# system setup scripts

These automation scripts are for my own homelab environment. Feel free to use them, although most of them are for specific use cases.

Ubuntu:

ubuntu_server_install.sh : Generates and updates locale and timezone settings. Installs chrony and syncs to timeserver. Installs auditd and sysmon with custom rules, and elastic agent.
